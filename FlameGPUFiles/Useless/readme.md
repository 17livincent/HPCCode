# FLAME GPU Example: EmptyExample

This project represents a minimal working example of a FLAME GPU simulation, providing a simple starting point for new models.

Useless model

Given a specific number of agents, each agent performs some arbitrary calculations at each iteration.  This is meant to be identical to a version on NetLogo for a timing comparison.
